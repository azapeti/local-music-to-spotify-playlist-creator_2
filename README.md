## Overview

Local Music to Spotify Playlist Creator is a Python application that allows users to convert their offline music collections into Spotify playlists. This enhanced **Terminal Edition** lets you turn your local music folder into a Spotify playlist directly from the terminal. It scans music files (like `.mp3`) for metadata or parses filenames, searches tracks on Spotify, and builds or updates your chosen playlist.
